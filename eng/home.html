					<h1>Exciting Sports</h1>
					<p>
					Get to know the saga of the sport that was born as a mal-finished version of English rugby and, in 151 years, has become one of the most exciting modalities on the planet. Certainly your friends ask you, "Why is this sport called 'football' if it's played with your hands?" To understand this, we need to go back in time, more specifically to the mid-19th century. At that time, many young people from families rich Americans went to live and study in Britain. And there they learned the two most popular sports: Association Football ("soccer") - played with feet and the round ball - and rugby football - a mode derived from the first, which included the use of hands as well. Upon returning to the United States, these students made the two sports scatter through the universities.

					<h1>National passion</h1>
					<p>
					As for its origin there is a lot of uncertainty and many people defend different theories and all of them with valid elements. What we can say is that golf was probably invented by the Scots, who by the 1400s practiced it, and in 1457 the Scottish Parliament forbade people to practice it because it was considered a distraction and it affected productivity from the country. Golf is played in grassy fields or in appropriate parks with one or more delimited courses.

					<h1>Basketball</h1>
					<p>
					In Brazil, the biggest championship is the CBB National. In addition to the regional championships, the strongest is that of São Paulo, won this year by the Unimed / Franca team. When it comes to national teams, the biggest championship is the FIBA (International Basketball Federation) World Championship, followed by the Olympics and Continental competitions, such as Pan. Now it's about clubs, the NBA and WNBA, the Euroleague, and continental competitions of clubs.

					<h1>Challenging sports for the few!</h1>
					<p>
					The current format has 16 teams in the main league, and three divisions of access: 12 teams in Division I, 12 teams in Division II, and the remaining teams in Division III. At the highest level, the teams are divided into 2 groups of 8, with the first four from each group going into the second phase, and the latter being relegated to Division I. The second phase is a single-game elimination tournament with quarter-final, semi-final, third and final match. Ice hockey games are played in three periods (times) of 20 minutes each, and separated by two intervals of 20 minutes each. In these periods, only the time in which the disc is in motion is counted - the time spent in the making of fouls, between a goal and a faceoff shot or even discussions, do not count. The chronometer is controlled by a game timekeeper.

					<h1>A lot of emotion!</h1>
					<p>
					An Olympic sport played on a skating rink between two teams of six players - where all players and judges wear ice skates. The objective of the game is to make the disc be placed in the goal of the opponent. A goal equals one point. The Beta phase debuted on April 10, 2009, running until October 26 of that year. Then, counting on 40 champions and two modes of play: the classic "five-on-five" at Summoner's Rift and a "three-on-three" at Twisted Treeline, LOL was fully official.
