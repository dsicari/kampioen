					<h1>The Basic</h1>
					<p>
					The team in possession of the ball tries to advance gradually, in short plays called "downs". If he can get the ball to the opponent's endzone, he scores the touchdown, which is worth 6 points. But there are also other ways to score, like the field goal, to kick through the posts that is worth 3 points.

					<h1>Teams</h1>
					<p>
					There are 11 athletes on the field for each team. As there is no substitution limit, players can enter and leave the game as many times as the coach wants. This way, when the team has the ball, it uses 11 attackers in the field. When he does not have the ball, he employs 11 defenders. In kicking moves, the so-called "specialists" enter.

					<h1>Game Time</h1>
					<p>
					There are four periods of 15 minutes, totaling 60 minutes of departure. But the timer is stopped in some situations: if the player with the ball leaves the side, if a team punctuates, if there is an incomplete pass (thrown ball that touches the ground before being caught) and if there is a foul.
					</p>

					<h1>Init and End of a Play</h1>
					<p>
					The so-called kickoff happens at the beginning of the first and second time. And also after any punctuation. The ball is positioned in the 35-yard line and kicked by the kicker towards the opponent's field. A player of the opposing team, the returning player, receives the kicked ball and tries to advance with it as much as he can until he is knocked over.
